# Security-Systems-for-Confidential-Documents
When working from home or other locations outside of the office, it is a problem to secure confidential 
information to make sure that only the right people have access, and leakage is minimized. Failing to safeguard 
confidential documents adequately could lead to issues such as leakage of intellectual property, compliance 
issues or reputational risks. Reports have shown that in the first quarter of 2020 alone, 67% percent of data 
breaches resulted from stolen or weak passwords, human error, and social attacks. Two-factor authentication 
protects you from various attacks, including phishing, social engineering, and password brute-force attacks. It 
not only protects you from these attacks, but it also protects your logins from attackers who use weak or stolen 
credentials. So, there is option to add speech recognition and password protection combines and then generate
QR using this. QR will include the all documents of the person. We added two- step verification for the 
documents of the specified person.
